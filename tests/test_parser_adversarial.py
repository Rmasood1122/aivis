Adversarial tests for aivis.parser.parse_tool_list.

Every test below asserts a specific field value against the behaviour of
src/aivis/parser.py as pasted on 2026-08-17 (177 lines). TARGET line numbers
refer to that file.

HOW THESE PREDICTIONS WERE CHECKED
----------------------------------
The pasted source was reconstructed byte-for-byte into a scratch package with
a dataclass stand-in for ToolEntry(rank, name_raw, name_norm, why,
citation_domains) and this file was executed against it: 14 passed, 1 failed,
matching every PREDICTION line below. That reconstruction is NOT your repo --
if your real models.ToolEntry validates or coerces any of those five fields,
that is the one place these results could diverge. Run the file for real.

PREDICTIONS CHANGED DURING THE LINE-BY-LINE RE-READ PASS
--------------------------------------------------------
None. No prediction flipped between drafting and re-derivation.

Two things did change, neither a prediction:
  C1. test_pe02_* originally used the input "1. - Great for sprint planning".
      Re-reading line 128 killed it: the fallback split is r"\s+-\s+", which
      requires whitespace BEFORE the hyphen, and a line-leading "- " has none.
      That input yields name_raw="- Great for sprint planning" and PE-03, not
      PE-02. Replaced with an empty bold pair, which does reach line 137.
  C2. test_pe04_* asserted ["asana", "asana"] and failed on first execution --
      my error, not the parser's: the middle entry is still in the list.
      Corrected to ["asana", "notion", "asana"]. Prediction was and stayed PASS.

STANDING NOTES FOUND WHILE DERIVING THESE TESTS (not bugs the tests assert,
but facts the reader needs):

  N1. PE-06 and OCV-01 are inseparable. Both early-return branches (lines
      76-83 and 93-101) emit PE-06 *and* OCV-01 together. There is no input
      that produces one without the other, so the two codes carry exactly
      one bit of information between them, not two.

  N2. parse_success (line 169) ignores parse_errors entirely. A list where
      every entry is missing its why-text returns parse_success=True with
      parse_errors=["PE-03"]. "Success" here means "shaped like a list",
      not "valid".

  N3. Duplicates are recorded, never removed (lines 142-145 then 153). The
      returned tool_list still contains both copies, so any downstream
      count of len(tool_list) is inflated by the duplicate.

  N4. The task asked for 7 error-code tests. Six error codes exist: PE-02,
      PE-03, PE-04, PE-06, OCV-01, OCV-02. The source emits no other code
      string, and PE-01 and PE-05 appear nowhere in it. There are 6 tests in
      that section, not 7. A seventh would have had to be invented.

  N5. There is no test here for PE-06 on empty input (lines 76-83) because it
      is not a realistic model response -- a model that returns "" is a
      transport failure, not a parse failure, and the test would assert the
      same three fields as the clarifying-question test.
